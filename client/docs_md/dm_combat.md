# Combat & Initiative
This section assumes a general knowledge of playing D&D.

## Initiative Management
When any player or NPC rolls for initiative, several new elements will appear at the bottom left of your screen.

![Initiative Options](../docs_imgs/init_opts.png)

The bottom bar displays the current and next NPCs or PCs in the initiative count.

Clicking either right-pointing arrow will advance the initiative count by 1, and update the initiative display accordingly. Hovering over either of the two PC or NPC icons will display their name.

The crossed-out circle icon ends the initiative count. If there is only one creature left in the initiative count, they cannot remove themselves from initiative, and you must click this button to end the initiative.

## Combat
When it is the turn of one of your NPCs, you can right-click any other NPC or PC and click **Attack** to attack them. Doing so will open a sidebar on the right side of your screen, with a list of your NPC's actions. You can also toggle on or off magic damage, along with advantage or disadvantage.

Depending on the creature, some number of its attacks will have automation enabled. Which ones these are can be determined by the fact that they list the attack bonus, damage, and type below the attack description. Clicking an automated attack will automatically roll for attack and damage on the selected target, respecting resistances, immunities, and vulnerabilities if needed. The damage, if any, will then be automatically applied and you will recieve a notification telling you if you hit, and how much damage you dealt.

Attacks that do not have automation do nothing if clicked, and are just there to display their descriptions.

When you are finished with your attacks and moves, you can then advance the initiative to the next person as described in the **Initiative Management** section of this document.

## Dice Rolling
You can roll dice using the icons at the bottom of the screen. Each of these rolls 1 die of the pictured type (the % symbol is a d100). If you want to roll a more complex dice roll, click the pencil icon and enter the roll string in the input box that comes up. By default, player dice roll results will appear in the Messages area, as described below.

## Messages
You can send messages to the party with the **Messages** icon next to the link at the top of your screen. Simply type what you want to send, then press the send button. The message window disappears if you click on any other part of the screen. Player roll results will also appear here, if you do not disable that function in Settings.
