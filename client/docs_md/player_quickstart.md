# Player Quickstart
This quickstart assumes a general knowledge of playing D&D.

## Loading a Character Sheet
As of right now, character sheets can be loaded from [GSheet V2.1](https://gsheet2.avrae.io). D&D Beyond support might be added in the future. The sheet itself has instructions on how to use it, on its **?** tab.

Once you have a character sheet made, make it shareable by link (Anyone with the link can **View**). Then, click the blank sheet icon at the bottom left of your screen, which is labeled as "Import Sheet" if you hover over it. In the input that comes up, paste the Google Sheets share link into the input box, and click **Set Sheet**. After a few seconds, you should get a message that says that your sheet was loaded.

If you make changes to your character sheet in Google Sheets, just click the **Update Sheet** button below the **Import Sheet** button to reload your sheet information. You can also set a new sheet by clicking **Import Sheet** again. HP will not be maintained between reloads.

## Using Your Character
Once you have a character imported, you can right-click on any open map and click **Add Player Character**. This will place your character in the nearest grid square to where you right-clicked.

You can move your character by clicking the **Move** icon in the upper right corner of the screen. You can then drag your character around the map it is placed on.

You can edit the statistics of your character by right-clicking on its icon. If you just need to change HP, you can click **Set HP**, **Set Maximum HP**, or **Change HP**. Each will bring up a dialog prompt explaining what needs to be input. If you need to change something more specific, you can click **Edit Statistics** to edit ability scores, AC, HP, andd your initiative bonus.

To remove a character from a map, click **Close Player Character** in the right-click menu.

## Dice Rolling
You can roll dice using the icons at the bottom of the screen. Each of these rolls 1 die of the pictured type (the % symbol is a d100). If you want to roll a more complex dice roll, click the pencil icon and enter the roll string in the input box that comes up.

## Initiative & Combat
You can roll initiative with the right-click menu. If you are not already in initiative, **Roll Initiative** will appear in your character's right click menu. Click that, and initiative will be automatically rolled for you.

On your turn in initiative, you can right click on any other PC or NPC on the map, and click **Attack**. This will bring up a list of your attacks, with options for Advantage, Disadvantage, and Magic Damage. Once you have these options set to your satisfaction, scroll to the attack that you want to use, and click it. This will roll the attack and appropriate damage (accounting for resistances, immunities, and vulnerabilities), and then apply it to your target. A message box will then appear on your screen, telling you the result of your attack.

If you want to remove yourself from initiative, right-click on your character and click **Remove from Initiative**. If this option does not appear, it is because you are the only person in initiative, or that it is your initiative count. If this is the case, the DM will have to advance or end the initiative.

## Sending Messages
You can send messages to the rest of the party with the **Messages** icon next to the link at the top of your screen. Simply type what you want to send, then press the send button. The message window disappears if you click on any other part of the screen.
