# About

## Premise
Xorien's Lair is a VTT, or Virtual TableTop, system for Dungeons & Dragons 5e. It aims to provide as many features as possible that compare with other VTTs (**Roll20**, **Fantasy Grounds**, etc) while remaining entirely free to use.

That being said, I am a student and this is hardly professional work. While it is functional, I do not pretend that it comes close to the functionality of those sites, and it probably never will. However, it should be just about as useful, especially for D&D players on a budget.

## Who is This "Xorien" Person?
Xorien Mechanos was my first-ever D&D character, now turned insane planeswalker after the ending of the last campaign I played him in. He was a rather generic elven wizard, complete with a bad British accent and a Gandalf-esque staff. Still, he was probably one of the most amusing characters I've ever played.

## Notes
Despite the size and breadth of Xorien's Lair, this is at its core a school project. I've poured a lot of love into it, and I will likely continue upgrading it along the way, as one of its main purposes was to provide me with a good alternative to Roll20 and/or Google Drawings. However, due to the complexity and my own limitations, not every feature is guaranteed to work outside of Chrome, on slow WiFi, or on mobile devices. I might try to implement support for these later on, but I might not.

Additionally, (provided that you are reading this on the site that I'm hosting) I host my projects from a desktop computer in my house. My WiFi is decently fast, but this is in no way a data center. So, if there's lag or the server goes down, that's probably why. In case of outages, create a GitHub issue or email me.

**Have fun, and may the dice be ever in your favor!**
