## Setup
1. Run `setup.py` to install the required libraries automatically
2. Edit the IP and PORT settings at the top of `__init__.py` to suit your needs (`S_PORT` is the port to run the website on, `A_PORT` hosts the API.) Optimally, you should keep these at 1022 and 1023 because the website has many references to these which are more difficult to change.
3. Run `__init__.py`
4. Go to `http://IP:S_PORT/client` to view the site
